The only requirement for membership is a  desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for AA membership. We are self supporting through our own contributions. AA is not allied with any sect, denomination,  politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage itself in any controversy;  neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and to help  other alcoholics achieve sobriety."

We request that all participants refrain from discussion of drugs and other addictions during this meeting. The Group does not condone profanity, please leave street language on the street! We ask that those of you with cell phones and pagers please mute them at this time. Also remember that “Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all of our traditions, ever reminding us that “who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here let it stay here!”"
